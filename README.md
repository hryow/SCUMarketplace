## Tech Stack
SCUMarketplace is built with the following technologies:
### Frontend
- React - Component-based library for building interactive user interfaces with efficient rendering and a rich ecosystem
- Vite - Modern build tool providing fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized development experience
### Backend
- Node.js - Event-driven JavaScript runtime for handling multiple concurrent users efficiently
- Express - Lightweight web framework for building REST APIs and managing server-side routing
### Database 
- PostgreSQL - Robust relational database for storing users, listings, tags, photos, buyer–seller messages, and sale transactions. Uses foreign key constraints, array columns, and triggers to ensure integrity (SCU-email enforcement, one-sale-per-listing) and provides fast querying and filtering across the marketplace. (CRUD Operations for: Users (signup & authentication with SCU-email enforcement), Listings (create, read, delete, mark as sold). Connected backend to the database using: pg connection pool and .env file containing configuration for secure credentials.

## Setup

1. To install the dependencies, run `npm install` in the Frontend folder and run `npm install` in the Server folder.
2. To start the application, run `npm run dev` in the Frontend folder and run `npm start` in the Server folder (use two terminals). 
- Currently, the server is configured to run on port 8080. Please make sure that there are no conflicting processes running on that port number.

## Testing 
This project uses a three-tier testing approach to ensure code quality and reliability.

### Unit Testing (Vitest)
Test individual React components and functions: `npm run test` in the Frontend folder

### Integration Testing (Jest)
Test backend API endpoints and database interactions: `npm run test:integration` in the Server folder 

### End-to-End Testing (Cypress)
Test complete user workflows in the browser: `npm run cypress:open`

### Running ALL Tests
To run all test suites before pushing code: `npm run test:all`  
See [Testing Documentation](./doc/TestingGuide.md) for detailed testing guidelines. 

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
